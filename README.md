# 7H-SteamDeck-Fix
Streamlining the installation process of 7th Heaven on Steam Deck

The script provided **AUTOMATICALLY** downloads:
* [7th-Heaven](https://github.com/tsunamods-codes/7th-Heaven/releases/) (Stable)

Steps:
* Clone the repository and put it anywhere you want
* Right click on `7HFix.sh` and select `Open Terminal Here`
* Type `chmod +x 7HFix.sh`
* Run the script with `./7HFix.sh`
* Follow the steps and enjoy!



Advanced:

* If you are unsure, run the script normally
